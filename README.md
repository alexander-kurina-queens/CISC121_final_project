## Problem Breakdown & Computational Thinking 
Bubble sort works by repeatedly going over each value in the unsorted part list and swapping values which are larger then the value at the next index of the list forward, this leads to the highest value being moved to the right-side of the list, which is then considered sorted and not included in the next swapping operation. This code provides a gradio based GUI/visualizer to show how bubble sort works of a list of "Array Size" integer entries of 0 to "Array Max" size.

## Steps to Run 
- open the huggingface space
- change the available settings to your desired configuration
- press the submit button
- the algorithm will automatically run and sort the randomly generated array
